# hello
Personal webpage

As you probably have guessed, "Hello" is my repository to store my personal website. Surprisingly, isn't it? :astonished: :joy:

# How I did the website
First, I created this website in my computer using Atom. 

I used Bootstrap to find some inspiration, but I created not only my own HTML but also the CSS. I wasn't supposed to do this, but I had some problems in the process, so I made a virtue out of necessity and I could customize more my website (and learn, by the way)

# How I uploaded the website
I created a new repository and, inside it, a new file. This file was named "docs/index,html". Once I had it, I copied my html code and pasted there. Then, commit changes. 

The next step was the css. I created a new file in the same folder (where I have the index.html) and stored it ending in .css. I gave it the name "indexstyle.css", so I needed to replace the name as well in index.html to actually relate the two documents. 

As a third step, I uploaded the .woff that I had used to make a spark character. Otherwise, it doesn't work (I proved it :sweat_smile:)

# How I got the URL
In the setting of the repository, go to Github Pages and select in Source "master-branch/doc-folder". Then save it and Github gives you an URL with your name first, then .github.io/ and the name of your repository. 

Beneath that option, there is a bottom to customize your domain. But I am still exploring the possibilities (if you're tempting of customizing with www.myfullname.com, don't do it, unless you have already the domain or you're more expert). 

# More ways
There are another ways of creating or uploading a website using Github.
